AfterMiddles
============

This is an experimental plugin to add a Rack-based after-filter-like layer
to ActionController. 

Example
=======

You get an initialize method for free (@app = app).

  class MyRackApp
    def call(env)
      status, headers, response = @app.call(env)
      [status, headers, response]
    end
  end

  class ItemsController
    after_middle MyRackApp
  end

More information
================

The after_middle method is a wrapper around before_filter. It adds the
class you give it to an array, and then before the response is sent, the
array is turned into a middleware stack which is processed.
